# Integrate path-planning algorithms with PDDL planners

## Objectives

* Understand the importance of path-planning in robotics.
* Study and implement well-known path planning algorithms.
* Compare the algorithms using different heuristics.
* Integrate PDDL planners with path planning algorihtms.


## Introduction

The pseudocode that will be used in this practical assignment is taken from the article [Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3843.pdf) published in the Journal of AI Research, 39: 533-579 (2010). 

The algorithms will be implemented in Python and it is strongly recommended to use Git and make ```Commits/``` betweens the members of the group (max 2 members). Besides the implementacion and the document explaining the last part of the assignment (in .md or txt), the students should also upload images of the solutions of the algorithms with the different heuristics using the map of the slides. 

The practical assignment is inspired in the article published by Pablo Muñoz, María D. R-Moreno and David F. Barrero. [Unified framework for path-planning and task-planning for autonomous robots](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889016302184?via%3Dihub). Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Vol. 82, pp:1-14 August 2016.
